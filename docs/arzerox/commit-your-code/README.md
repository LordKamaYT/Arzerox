# Commit Your Code

#### Commit Your Code

Once you've setup your push origin, you will want to push everytime you change something in your code. Using Arzerox's code, you will have two options to push :

* [manual-commit.md](manual-commit.md "mention")
* [automatic-commit.md](automatic-commit.md "mention")
