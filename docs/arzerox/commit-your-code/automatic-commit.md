# Automatic Commit

**Automatic Commit**

You don't necessarily have to run all the commands manually, you can use one of Arzerox's automation files. To commit automatically, you will want to open one of the following :

* Git Bash
* Command Prompt

Then, you will want to run `./commit.bat` in your console.
